# Portfolio

A fully responsive website made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to show off my skills, projects, and contact info. It’s easy to use and looks great on any device, with sections about what I can do, the projects I’ve worked on, and a way for people to get in touch. The design is clean and interactive, with a black/crimson theme.
